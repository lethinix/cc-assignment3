###for my assignment 3 i used code by Al Sweigart from the scroll art museum. i edited a few parts of the code: 
- the width of the art
- the range for i
- i added delay changes so that the scroll art speeds up and slows down
- i changed the characters so that it uses characters from my name, and some other cute ones
